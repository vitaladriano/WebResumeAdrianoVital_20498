#Development Process
Making this webresume was a big challenge were days and days of research and learning. I could see my difficulties with CSS.
As you can see on the file attached I worked on the layout in the Paint program, because I have no experience with Axure .
Positioning images, icons and texts was very complicated, navbar also made me lose a little time and some research.
 I started to make small codes to see the result and gradually adapted.

#Initial ideas
when I´m started think abort this Project i wanted make something clean and easy to find the information.
